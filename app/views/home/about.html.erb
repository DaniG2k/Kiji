	Kiji started in the valleys of a faraway land, amidst a war between the gods
	of Faragon and the demons of Kriit.

	Err, no that's not how it goes. Kiji started in a small room in London. But before that,
	it emerged from a desire to make sense of today's information overload. What better
	way to do	so than by leveraging social media?
</p>
<p>
	It's lovely to read an article that says "1.5k likes". Yet this provides us readers
	with ZERO frame of reference as to how that stands compared to other articles.
	What's more, it provides us	with ZERO reference as to how that performs with respect
	to other news sources.
</p>
<p>
	Kiji is a response to this mess. <strong>Kiji is a platform that cleans up
  today's information overload.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Every day, we gather data from multiple news sources and present them to you in a coherent
	way - not merely by how many likes or shares an article may have, but also by how that
	compares to other articles from different news sources.
</p>
<p>
	This is a democratic form of reading. Not only are you helping your peers access good content
	every time you share something, it also helps lesser known news sources get a fair
	chance at being heard. Our algorithms let these democratically selected articles bubble to
	the top.
</p>
<p>
	Well, now that introductions are out of the way, <%= link_to "happy reading", root_path %>!
